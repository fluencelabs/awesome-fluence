## Database
* [SQLite fork](https://github.com/fluencelabs/sqlite) — a lightweight SQL database ported to WebAssembly that could be used as of the modules inside an app or as a standalone application.
* [Redis fork](https://github.com/fluencelabs/redis) — a NoSQL in-memory database that persists on disk.
* [Llamadb fork](https://github.com/fluencelabs/llamadb) — an SQL database written in Rust, great to play around with.

All of these databases are available at the [Fluence Dashboard](http://dash.fluence.network/deploy).

## Serverless
### REPL
REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an application on Fluence (just as a database) that allows developers to create scripts and execute them without compiling into Wasm.
* A REPL for [Rhai](https://github.com/viraja1/rhai_functions_fluence) – embedded scripting c-like language for Rust.
* A REPL for [Ketos](https://github.com/bakaoh/ketos-dapp) – Lisp dialect embedded in Rust.

## Library
* [VRF](https://github.com/mixbytes/fluence-VRF) — decentralized verifiable random functions.

## Resources
* [Dashboard](http://dash.fluence.network/) — deploy and manage your application, monitor the network state.
* [Documentation](https://fluence.dev/) — comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with Fluence as fast as possible.
* [Quickstart](https://fluence.dev/docs/quickstart) — learn the basics of backend and frontend development on Fluence.
